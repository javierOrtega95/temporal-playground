## Why Temporal?

Unlike the legacy `Date` object, [Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/) provides:

- ✅ **Timezone-aware calculations** without surprises
- ✅ **Immutable date/time objects** that prevent bugs  
- ✅ **Clear, explicit APIs** for common use cases
- ✅ **First-class support** for calendars and non-Gregorian systems

## What's this playground?

An interactive learning environment with:

- 🎨 **16 curated examples** — from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- ⚡ **Live code execution** — edit code, see results instantly
- 📝 **Side-by-side comparisons** — understand differences with Date
- 💡 **Full TypeScript support** — autocomplete and type checking
- 🛠️ **Monaco Editor** — the same editor as VS Code

No setup required — runs entirely in your browser.
